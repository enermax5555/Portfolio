## How to setup

   In order to get this project on local directory to test it u will need the follow things:
   
1. Install Git & Node.js
2. Clone the repository on ur local directory:
> git clone https://github.com/enermax5555/Portfolio
3. After u got the copy u will need to install dependancies:
> npm install
4. Then u can start a Node.js server:
>npm start
5. By default the server will be open on port:3000, so just enter this url in ur browser:
>localhost:3000

In case of broken url: You can always go on the terminal window, where u ran the server and check the exact port for ur localhost.
