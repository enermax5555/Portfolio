## Technologies 

I wanted to create a simple web developer portfolio, using only React and TaiwindCSS, where I can say something about me and also show my work, skills and experience so far.

- __React.js__
- __Tailwind CSS__
- __EmailJS__

Navigation bar to surf easy in-page.

Project section, where you can find photos and links, to github repositories, of my projects
    
Contact form, using EmailJS service, to send me personal email, if anyone want to contact me.

## How to setup

   In order to get this project on local directory, you will need to do this:
   
1. Install Git & Node.js
2. Clone the repository on your local directory:
> git clone https://github.com/enermax5555/Portfolio
1. After you got the copy, you will need to install dependencies:
> npm install
1. Then you can start a Node.js server:
>npm start
1. By default the server will be open on port:3000, so just enter this url in your browser:
>localhost:3000

In case of broken url: You can always go on the terminal window, where you ran the server and check the exact port for your localhost.
