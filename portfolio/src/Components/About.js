            <p>I am studing for web developer. I like to create, good
                looking, web applications. After i graduated from high-school,
                i decided to start learn programming. I applied for new bulgarian
                university, where accepted me with Informational Technologies.
                First years we studied low-level languages like C, C++. After
                we moved to Web Programming, where i find my self. We just got
                some of the basics with HTML, CSS and JS, but still, it fel wonderful
                to create a web-page all by my self. After i created my first
                info-site only using html, css and some js, i was feeling great, but i
                decided that this is not enough, cause it wasn't so responsive, also
                was not having anything dynamic(only css animations xD), 
                it was hard to maintain the code and so on. And there is where everything
                start. First i decided to do some free courses about the responsive desing,
                then, completed some js free courses, applied to some web-academies like Boom.dev
                I learned a lot out of these and decided to move to next-step building a
                e-commerce website. First it was very tough, cause creating all the business
                logic is hard. I also wanted, to create a web-site that a non-programmer can
                easily use like, post new articles, change the stock of products,
                give a description and information about e-commerce purposes and so on.
                Then i found python, i mean, i already knew the basics from university
                i just needed to improve it a little bit. With his framework Django i
                manage to build my first e-commercinal website. It tooks me like couple
                of months, step-by-step upgrading, but finnaly i was done. Then i done
                some web-animation using PIXI.js(boom.dev course). Also created some
                levels in Unreal4 engine and Unity. Then i am back here with this portfolio
                builded on React.js using Taiwind CSS for styling and
